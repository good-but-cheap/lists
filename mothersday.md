## What you need to know
Mother’s Day is a time to honor and celebrate the incredible women who have shaped our lives with love, guidance, and unwavering support. It’s an opportunity to express gratitude and appreciation for all that mothers do. One of the most meaningful ways to show your love on Mother’s Day is by selecting a thoughtful gift that reflects her interests, personality, and the special bond you share. Here’s a what we look for in a Mother's Day gift:

### Interests and Hobbies
Consider what brings joy to your mother's life. Does she have any hobbies or passions that she dedicates her time to? Whether she loves gardening, cooking, reading, painting, or exploring the outdoors, selecting a gift that aligns with her interests shows that you appreciate and support her individuality.

### Pay Attention to Needs
Think about any challenges or desires your mother may have expressed recently. Does she mention needing a new kitchen appliance, wanting to learn a new skill, or longing for relaxation time? By addressing her needs and fulfilling her wishes, you demonstrate thoughtfulness and attentiveness to her well-being.

### Create an Experience
Sometimes the most memorable gifts are experiences that create lasting memories. Treat your mother to an at home spa day, cooking class, or movie night. These experiences allow you to spend quality time together and create new moments to cherish.
